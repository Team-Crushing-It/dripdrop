## What is dripdrop?

Dripdrop makes transparent your water quality, your usage and the impact you have on the world through a sensor and a  mobile app. Providing real-time feedback about the pH, temp, EC and TDS, you can challenge your friends to save every drop!

Challenged by the #Hack20 Flutter Hackathon, Team Crushing it designed this app to empower consumers with data and to make way for the cyberpunk future built with retro aesthetic. 

## Our Design

Our design is a continuous panel where you can swipe left or right to focus on your water data or how your usage compares with your friends!

It is split into three pages

## Home Page

Our Home Page gives a quick overview, gives you feedback about your water usage, shares relevant news stories about water and has a view of the realtime data points regarding your water.

## Data Page

Swiping to the left, you can see detailed information about your water, such as the monthly usage, the TDS and EC. 

## Leaderboard Page

The best part about this app is that it lets you challenge your friends to see who can save the most water. No one is taking bets over here (officially), some of us may be a little too competitive, but it's all in good cheer and opens up your eyes to how your water usage affects the community. It's a pandemic, who needs to take showers??

The Pacman look was the most enjoyable part of this project!
