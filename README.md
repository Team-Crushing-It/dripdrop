## What is dripdrop?

Dripdrop makes transparent your water quality, your usage and the impact you have on the world through a sensor and a  mobile app. Providing real-time feedback about the pH, temp, EC and TDS, you can challenge your friends to save every drop!

Challenged by the #Hack20 Flutter Hackathon, Team Crushing it designed  this app to save the world with data about our water and challenge ourselves to make it in the competition theme of retro/cyberpunk.
