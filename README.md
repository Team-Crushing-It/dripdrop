## Inspiration

Challenged by the #Hack20 Flutter Hackathon, Team Crushing it designed this app to empower consumers with data and to make way for the cyberpunk future built with retro aesthetic. 

See our live demo and hackathon submittal @ https://youtu.be/D5T3_cqTmkw

## Our Design

Built with ðŸ’— on Flutter and Firebase, this app uses realtime water data to empower the consumer with a clear understanding of their water quality and usage.

Our design is a continuous panel where you can swipe left or right to focus on your water data or how your usage compares with your friends!

It is split into three pages
